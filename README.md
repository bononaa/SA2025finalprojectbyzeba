 # Dynamic Pricing System for Urban Parking Lots

This project addresses the challenge of dynamic pricing in urban parking zones by using real-time and historical factors to compute optimal prices. The solution was developed as part of **Summer Analytics 2025** by the Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati.

==================


# Overview

Urban cities often face parking congestion, stockouts, and underutilization due to static pricing. This project creates a three-layered pricing system for parking lots:

- **Model 1**: Baseline (fixed rate)
- **Model 2**: Demand-based pricing (based on queue length, occupancy, weather, vehicle type, etc.)
- **Model 3**: Competitive pricing (adjusts price based on nearby lots and demand)
- Also integrated **real-time streaming** simulation using **Pathway**, making the solution dynamic and deployable.
